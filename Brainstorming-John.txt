Automation
	-A puzzle game that's sorta like Factorio, where you have a thing that you're trying to produce with 
	 a mechanical assembly line, but there are set levels and everything's on one screen

Break the cycle
	-A puzzle game that's kinda like the opposite of the one above, where there's already some automated cycle
	 going on and you have to move pieces around in a certain way to make the cycle stop. This one would be
	 really hard to make because we would have to design it so that the cycle continues in many different
	 scenarios

Control the environment, not the player
	-A platformer that works like Super Monkey Ball, but in 2D
	-A platformer where you control a Rube Goldberg machine and you have to get a ball from start to finish
	 using the various contraptions. You may also be able to control where gravity is pointed, so the ball
	 could roll down a horizontal surface if necessary

Each playthrough builds on the last
	-A 3 to 5 screen game where once you reach the end, you start from the first screen again, but everything
	 you did the first time affects each screen this time. (ex. The family of an enemy you killed is gathered
	 for its funeral, some guy who watched you die on one of the screens is talking to a therapist and has
	 a breakdown when he sees you again, etc.)

Everything grows
	-Puzzle/platformer where both the player and all the platforms can grow in size when clicked, but they can't
	 shrink back down
	-A game that you kinda just walk through where each new screen is just the previous screen, but with time
	 passed. So like in first screen there's like a tree sapling and some guy, then there's a small tree and
	 a tent, then there's a normal tree and a house, etc.

It only changes when you aren't looking
	-I have no idea

Sacrifices must be made
	-That one game where your corpses help you platform
	-An RPG where you start out with like 100 party members or something and they act as your HP, but they
	 can't be replaced and when you run out, you die

Absorb your enemies
	-Kirby
	-A stealth-like game where you want to avoid enemies because when you touch them, they get absorbed into
	 you and you become more evil or something

Darkness is your friend
	-A literal take on it: you're a boy asleep in bed but you wake up and befriend what appears to be like a
	 shadow or something. You go about the house having fun with your new friend until the sun comes up and
	 he disappears
	-Platforms only exist when it's dark, but you can only see them when it's light (overdone, I know)
	-Platforms are white, background is dark, when white lights shine on platforms, they stop existing

Don't trust the game
	-Text-based adventure where you're literally talking to the game (some visuals)

Magic, but at what cost?
	-A magic meter
	-Makes the game stupidly easy, but every time you use it one of the main character's friends/family members 
	 dies. Either that or it makes the character look more and more stupid (clown shoes, bad color palette, etc.)

Making connections
	-No idea

One item, many uses
	-Platformer where one button is assigned to the item (let's say "X", also item = magic wand) and you use 
	 different combinations of the arrow keys to do different things (UP+X - spin it like a propeller and fly
	 upwards, DOWN+X - use it like a pogo stick and jump far forwards, LEFT+X - throw it behind you like
	 a boomerang, RIGHT+X - extend it forward, pushing everything in front of you away
	-A minigame collection all centering around the same item. One minigame could be like an egg race where
	 the egg is balanced on the item, one could be like a Galaga thing where the item shoots bullets, etc.

Take one, leave one
	-You have a bunch of different items that can be used in different ways, but you can only carry one at a
	 time. There's no specific item required for each area, but some items will make certain areas easier

Two connected worlds
	-Changes you make/enemies you kill in one world affect the other world

Evolve
	-Spore
	-Every game like agar.io
	-A game where Ronald Reagan teaches you about how evolution is a conspiracy made up by the libs
	-The further you get through the game, the more abilities you get and the more things you can do
