Automation
	-A puzzle game that's sorta like Factorio, where you have a thing that you're trying to produce with 
	 a mechanical assembly line, but there are set levels and everything's on one screen

Break the cycle
	-A puzzle game that's kinda like the opposite of the one above, where there's already some automated cycle
	 going on and you have to move pieces around in a certain way to make the cycle stop. This one would be
	 really hard to make because we would have to design it so that the cycle continues in many different
	 scenarios

Control the environment, not the player
	-A platformer that works like Super Monkey Ball, but in 2D
	-A platformer where you control a Rube Goldberg machine and you have to get a ball from start to finish
	 using the various contraptions. You may also be able to control where gravity is pointed, so the ball
	 could roll down a horizontal surface if necessary

Each playthrough builds on the last
	-A 3 to 5 screen game where once you reach the end, you start from the first screen again, but everything
	 you did the first time affects each screen this time. (ex. The family of an enemy you killed is gathered
	 for its funeral, some guy who watched you die on one of the screens is talking to a therapist and has
	 a breakdown when he sees you again, etc.)

Everything grows
It only changes when you aren't looking
Sacrifices must be made
Absorb your enemies
Darkness is your friend
Don't trust the game
Magic, but at what cost?
Making connections
One item, many uses
Take one, leave one
Two connected worlds
